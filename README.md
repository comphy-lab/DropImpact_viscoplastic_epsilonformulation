# DropImpact_viscoplastic_epsilonformulation

This project contains C implementations for simulating two-phase flows, such as bouncing drops.

## Files in the Project

- `bounce.c`: Implementation of bouncing bubble simulation
- `two-phaseVP.h`: Header file for two-phase flow simulations
- `run_run.sh`: The script file for running the simulations in parallel. 
- `run_post.sh`: The script file for postprocess in parallel. 

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you'll need:

- Basilisk C preinstalled. See: [Basilisk](https://basilisk.fr/)
